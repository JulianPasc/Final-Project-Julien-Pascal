# Final-Project-Julien-Pascal

This repository contains a replication of the Paper from Jean Marc Robin (2011) "On the Dynamics of Unemployment and Wage Distribution" built from scratch on Matlab.

For the moment, the code is not optimized and the value function iteration procedures to solve for the wages is extremely long to run.

My aim is to:
- translate it to Julia
- optimize the code 

To run the code, execute the file main.m. This repository also contains the graphs that are generated by main.m

Update 1:
- I have included a version that runs with Julia
- Run the file "main2.jl"
- The value function iteration for the wages is still slow (slightly more than 20 mn)
