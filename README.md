# Final-Project-Julien-Pascal

This repository contains a replication of the Paper from Jean Marc Robin (2011) "On the Dynamics of Unemployment and Wage Distribution" built from scratch on Matlab.

For the moment, the code is not optimized (at all) and the value function iteration procedures to solve for the wages takes decades to run.

My aim is to:
- translate it to Julia
- optimize the code (vectorize the value function iterations)

To run the code, execute the file main.m
